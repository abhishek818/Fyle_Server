#Problem Statement

The coding challenge is divided into 2 parts.

1. Develop a REST service(preferably, but not necessarily in [Django](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/))
2. Develop a single page web app (preferably, but not necessarily in [Angular 2+](https://angular.io/)) that fetches and displays the data fetched from the API built in part 1

## **Part 1:**

You need to create a REST service that can fetch bank details, using the data given in the APIâ€™s query parameters.

You can use the data available in this [repository](https://github.com/snarayanank2/indian_banks) in your backend DB. Write your service in any language of your choice. Host it on Heroku - you can sign up for a free account in Heroku. E.g. [Here are steps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) on how you can get a Django app running in Heroku in a few minutes. Please use PostgreSQL as your backend DB. Since the free-tier of Heroku has a limit of 10k rows, you can use another DB provider (eg: you can use [clever-cloud.com](https://www.clever-cloud.com/) to host your Postgres DB by [following steps](https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/addons/clever-cloud-addons/)).

Essentials your applications should have:

1. Autocomplete API to return possible matches based on the branch name **ordered by IFSC code** (ascending order) with limit and offset.
    1. **Endpoint: /api/branches/autocomplete?q=<>**
    2. Example: /api/branches/autocomplete?q=**RTGS**&limit=3&offset=0
    3. Sample response:

    ```json
    {
       "branches":[
          {
             "ifsc":"ABHY0065001",
             "bank_id":60,
             "branch":"RTGS-HO",
             "address":"ABHYUDAYA BANK BLDG., B.NO.71, NEHRU NAGAR, KURLA (E), MUMBAI-400024",
             "city":"MUMBAI",
             "district":"GREATER MUMBAI",
             "state":"MAHARASHTRA"
          },
          {
             "ifsc":"ABNA0000001",
             "bank_id":110,
             "branch":"RTGS-HO",
             "address": "414 EMPIRE COMPLEX, SENAPATI BAPAT MARG LOWER PAREL WEST MUMBAI 400013",
             "city":"MUMBAI",
             "district":"GREATER BOMBAY",
             "state":"MAHARASHTRA"
          },
          {
             "ifsc":"ADCB0000001",
             "bank_id":143,
             "branch":"RTGS-HO",
             "address":"75, REHMAT MANZIL, V. N. ROAD, CURCHGATE, MUMBAI - 400020",
             "city":"MUMBAI",
             "district":"MUMBAI CITY",
             "state":"MAHARASHTRA"
          },
          {
             "ifsc":"ADCC0000001",
             "bank_id":61,
             "branch":"RTGS-HO",
             "address": "THE AKOLA DISTRICT CENTRAL COOP. BANK LTD., P.B.NO. 8, CIVIL LINES, S.A. COLLEGE ROAD, AKOLA. 444001",
             "city":"AKOLA",
             "district":"AKOLA",
             "state":"MAHARASHTRA"
          }
       ]
    }
    ```

2. Search API to return possible matches across all columns and all rows, **ordered by IFSC code** (ascending order) with limit and offset.

1. **Endpoint: /api/branches?q=<>**
2. Example: /api/branches?q=**Bangalore**&limit=4&offset=0
3. Sample response:

```json
{
   "branches":[
      {
         "ifsc":"ABNA0100318",
         "bank_id":110,
         "branch":"BANGALORE",
         "address":"PRESTIGE TOWERS', GROUND FLOOR, 99 & 100, RESIDENCY ROAD, BANGALORE 560 025.",
         "city":"BANGALORE",
         "district":"BANGALORE URBAN",
         "state":"KARNATAKA"
      },
      {
         "ifsc":"ADCB0000002",
         "bank_id":143,
         "branch":"BANGALORE",
         "address": "CITI CENTRE, 28, CHURCH STREET, OFF M. G. ROAD BANGALORE 560001",
         "city":"BANGALORE",
         "district":"BANGALORE URBAN",
         "state":"KARNATAKA"
      },
      {
         "ifsc":"ALLA0210217",
         "bank_id":11,
         "branch":"K. G. ROAD",
         "address": "NO. 2, FKCCI BUILDING, K G ROAD, BANGALORE",
         "city":"BANGALORE",
         "district":"BANGALORE URBAN",
         "state":"KARNATAKA"
      },
      {
         "ifsc":"ALLA0210326",
         "bank_id":11,
         "branch": "BANGALORE BASAVANGUDI",
         "address":"121, RM COMPLEX, DR.D.V.GUNDAPPA ROAD, BASAVANGUDI, BANGALORE - 560004",
         "city":"BANGALORE",
         "district":"BANGALORE URBAN",
         "state":"KARNATAKA"
      }
   ]
}
```

## Part 2:

You need to develop a single page web app .

The app should list and search for banks that are fetched from the API developed in Part 1. There should be a dropdown for cities (just put in 5 cities in there) and there is a search bar. As I type in the search area, the table should be dynamically filtered (client-side filtering). Search should be across all fields.

Essentials your applications should have:

1. bank search screen which would show a list of banks
2. user should be able to search by text for the banks, across all the fields (important: there would be no search button)
3. pagination for the results of the search, the user should be able to select page size
4. mark some banks as **favourites**. View banks that were marked as favourites (favourites should persist state event if the website is refreshed or reloaded)
5. API calls should be cached
6. your application should be deployed to Heroku

For extra fun, you can try the following:

1. clicking on bank name would redirect to a bank page, with a route like *banks/{bankid}* that displays the details of the bank

Please note: The below mock-up is for reference only. You are free to do the styling as you please.
